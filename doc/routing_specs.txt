## NETWORK PACKETS
All information exchange by the nodes is encapsuled by a packet structure blueprint, containing an array of destination mote ids,
an array of source mote ids, the payload and a type identifier. The ids are given as unsigned chars (bytes). The payload as unsigned char (byte)
array. Thus also providing the possibility to assign strings as payload. Dest & Src arrays are used by path-based routing to find
the correct path of the packet.
The following packet types are defined:
Type                Description                           Payload
0     (Broadcast)   Network discovery packet              Timestamp of Network discovery
1     (Unicast)     Route Request (RREQ) Reply packet     None
2     (Broadcast)   Request for integration to network    None
3     (Unicast)     Reply to (2) new integrated node      None
>=10  (Unicast)     Data packets
  10                Toggle LED                            LED color identifier integer
  11                Set Thresholds                        Thresholds formated as string
  12                Request Thresholds                    None
  13                Thresholds                            All thresholds of target node, formated as string
  14                Request Sensor data                   integer to identify temp, hum or light
  15                Sensors data                          All sensors data, identified by request
  16                Request Routing Table                 None
  17                Routing Table                         Routing table, same format as in files
