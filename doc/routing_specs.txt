## CONTIKI STRUCTURE
Following processes are running in parallel:
Process         Description
p_serial        Serial Event Listener Process
p_conn          Process handling all broadcast and unicast connections and transmissions
p_sensors       Process handling sensor data on nodes and managing thresholds


## FILE STRUCTURE
CFS is used to store data on non-volatile flash memory of the motes in order to keep the information beyond restarts of nodes.
The routing tables and the sensor data + thresholds are saved in the flash memory.


## NETWORK PACKETS
All information exchange by the nodes is encapsuled by a packet structure blueprint, containing an array of destination mote ids,
an array of source mote ids, the payload and a type identifier. The ids are given as unsigned chars (bytes). The payload as unsigned char (byte)
array. Thus also providing the possibility to assign strings as payload. Dest & Src arrays are used by path-based routing to find
the correct path of the packet.
The following packet types are defined:
Type                Description                           Payload
0     (Broadcast)   Network discovery packet              Timestamp of Network discovery
1     (Unicast)     Route Request (RREQ) Reply packet     None
2     (Broadcast)   Request for integration to network    None
3     (Unicast)     Reply to (2) new integrated node      None
>=10  (Unicast)     Data packets
  10                Toggle LED                            LED color identifier integer
  11                Set Thresholds                        Thresholds formated as string
  12                Request Thresholds                    None
  13                Thresholds                            All thresholds of target node, formated as string
  14                Request Sensor data                   integer to identify temp, hum or light
  15                Sensors data                          All sensors data, identified by request
  16                Request Routing Table                 None
  17                Routing Table                         Routing table, same format as in files


## SERIAL COMMUNICATION
Nodes are constantly listen to serial inputs from the UART to react on formatted string commands from the GUI/Terminal.
Data transfer from nodes to GUI are string formatted commands enclosed in `<>`.

## ROUTING
#### SETUP
We have one central GUI node and all other regular nodes. Communication and data transfer is only between GUI node and any
other node in the network. Thus the regular nodes only need to know how to reach the GUI node. The GUI node however needs to
know at least one path to any (and all) regular nodes.

#### NETWORK DISCOVERY
A network discovery is required to build the network and is initialized by the GUI node broadcasting a packet with its id in
the src array. All nodes then perform controlled flooding, i.e. each node only forwards unkown packets to avoid loops and 
append their id to the src array. Inparticular, the if a new incoming packet already has the id of the processing node in 
the src array, the packet will not be forwarded.
Once a node receives a broadcast network discovery packet it appends the src array of the packet (i.e. the route to the gui)
to the routing table and starts a timeout, which triggers the routing algorithm after expiring. The timer is reset when new
network discovery packets arrive, in order to consider as many routes as possible for the routing algorithm. The routing 
algorithm chooses the best/optimal route by minimizing over the number of hops. We save the index of the best route in the
routing table. The respective nodes now send their best route in form of an RREQ Reply packet (type 1) with the optimal 
route as path to the gui. The gui now knows how to reach the node through the optimal route (given in the src array of the 
packet) and saves it to the routing table.
Each network discovery is identified by a timestamp, which is known by all nodes in the network. If the network discovery is
restarted or initialized by another node, the new timestamp will differ from the one cached in the memory and thus the nodes
clear their routing table, recognizing that the network has changed.
